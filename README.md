## 🧩 System Architecture

### 📚 Phase 1: RAG Pipeline
- Ingest and chunk documents using LangChain loaders.
- Embed and store in a vector DB with rich metadata.
- Implement hybrid retrieval with re-ranking.

### 🛠️ Phase 2: Agent Layer
- Tools:
  - `DocumentQATool`
  - `CSVDataAnalysisTool`
  - `CalendarTool`
  - `EmailDraftTool`
- ReAct-style agent with tool selection logic and prompt-based reasoning.

### ✅ Phase 3: Evaluation
- RAG and agent performance metrics:
  - Context Recall/Precision
  - Answer Faithfulness
  - Task Completion Rate
  - Latency & Token Cost

### 🚀 Phase 4: Deployment
- Containerized FastAPI server with endpoints like `/chat`.
- GitHub Actions pipeline for CI/CD.
- Hosted on AWS with monitoring via CloudWatch.
